# Redux Toolkit TypeScript Example

This example shows how to integrate Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

The **Redux Toolkit** is a standardized way to write Redux logic (create actions and reducers, setup the store with some default middlewares like redux devtools extension). This example demonstrates each of these features with Next.js

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example):

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```
